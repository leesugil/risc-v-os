## Hardware (Machine)
qemu riscv virt
You can learn everything about the machine in the source code of QEMU
RISC-V VIRT (such as memory mapping addresses).

### Get QEMU Running
> qemu-system-riscv64 -M virt -smp 4 -m 128M -nographic -serial mon:stdio -bios none -kernel kernel.elf
**Eexecutable and Linkable Format (ELF)** is a common standard file format for
executable files and the standard binary file format for Unix and Unix-like
systems on x86 processors.

####parameters
- cpu architecture (risc-v 64 bit)
- virtual machine / no
- number of cores
- memory (RAM)
- no/yes graphic
- serial interface
- kernel (that we're going to build)

## Linker Script
kernel.lds
**ld** is the linker of object files in Unix-like systems that is used at the
last step of compilation.
A linker script explicitly control over the link process.
